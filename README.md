bootstra.386-genesis
====================
WordPress Genesis Child Theme setup to using [BOOTSTRA.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386),
an amazing 1980's inspired Bootstrap Theme.

Built with
----------
- [BOOTSTRA.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386), Bootstrap Theme that captures the 1980s
- [Bootstrap Genesis](https://github.com/salcode/bootstrap-genesis) a Genesis WordPress Starter Child Theme

Installation
------------
I recommend downloading the latest [release](/releases).
If you are adding this theme to an existing project, 
you'll most likely want to delete the .gitignore file since
the .gitignore file ignores the compiled CSS and JS by default
( css/style.min.css and js/javascript.min.js ).
